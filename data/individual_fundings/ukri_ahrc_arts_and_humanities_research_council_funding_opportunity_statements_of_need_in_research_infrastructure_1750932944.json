  "description": "EPSRC wishes to understand the scale, range, nature, and scientific value of potential large-scale infrastructure investments in the UK to help inform future decision-making. Representatives of relevant scientific communities are invited to submit statements of need according to the assessment criteria. You must be based at a UK research organisation eligible for Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funding. No funding is available with this opportunity, although indicative full economic costs (FEC â€“ including resource costs) will be required. There is no upper limit on the financial request, but this should be justified with evidence.",
