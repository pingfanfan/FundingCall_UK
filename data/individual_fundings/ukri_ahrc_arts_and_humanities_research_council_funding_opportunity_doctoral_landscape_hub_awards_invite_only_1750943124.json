  "description": "An invitation only funding opportunity to apply for hub funding to provide cohort training and development opportunities for Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)-funded students within a defined region. AHRC has identified seven hub regions with HEIs in receipt of Doctoral Landscape Awards grouped in these regions. Each hub will receive funding over an eight-year period to support cohort training and development activity for AHRC-funded students and to contribute to the administration and management costs of the hub. Hubs will provide opportunities for students to undertake activities across the duration of the studentsâ€™ funded period. You can only apply for this funding opportunity if we have invited your organisation to do so. To lead a project, you must be based at an eligible organisation which holds a Landscape award in the region. Check if your organisation is eligible.",
