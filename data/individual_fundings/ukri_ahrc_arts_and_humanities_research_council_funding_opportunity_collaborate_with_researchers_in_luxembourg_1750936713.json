UKRI will receive and assess joint applications from eligible UK and Luxembourg applicants on behalf of both organisations. This is not a separate research funding scheme. UKRI and FNR will co-fund applications to UKRI councilsâ€™ responsive mode funding opportunities, in some cases named standard research grant opportunities. This page will change to reflect the new UKRI Funding Service. See How applicants use the Funding Service.",
