The aim is to give participants the confidence and skills they need to make a successful return to research. They provide an opportunity to balance a personalised retraining programme with a challenging research project, in a supportive UK university or research establishment. They are flexible, with at least 100 hours retraining per year, and part-time â€“ usually completed over two years at 0.5 full-time equivalent although some UKRI funders may award longer than this.",
